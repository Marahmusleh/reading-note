**How I keep myself in a _growth mindest_**

>I always try to have the power to change negativity to positivity,to achieve this, i must be optimistic about my chances for success.Without optimism i can't move forward.

- I record positive events in my day,no matter how small to focus on the positivies around me.
- When i make a mistake or fall short of a goal, I haven't failed , I have learned.
- I take my time to learn, i don't expect to master every topic under the sun in one setting.
