# Forms

Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred
to a printed document that contains
spaces for you to fill in information.
HTML borrows the concept of a form to refer to different
elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to
your site.

# Why Forms?

In addition to enabling users to
search, forms also allow users
to perform other functions
online. You will see forms
when registering as a member
of a website, when shopping
online, and when signing up for
newsletters or mailing lists.

# Form Controls

There are several types of form controls that
you can use to collect information from visitors
to your site.

+ ADDING TEXT
+ Making Choices
+ Submitting Forms
+ Uploading Files.

# Form Structure

+ Form
Form controls live inside a form element. This element
should always carry the action attribute and will usually have a
method and id attribute too.
+ action
Every form element requires an action attribute. Its value
is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the
information in the form when it is submitted.
+ method
Forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post.
  
  ```
  <form action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php"
   method="get">
   <p>This is where the form controls will appear.
   </p>
   </form>
  
  ```

+ **padding** to set the space
between the border of each table cell and its content
+ **text-transform** to convert the content of the table headers to uppercase.

to add additional styling to the content of the table headers
+ **border-top, border-bottom**
to set borders above and below the table headers
+ **text-align** to align the writing
to the left of some table cells and
to the right of the others
+ **background-color** to change
the background color of the
alternating table rows
