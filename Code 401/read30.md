# Hashtables
* Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose.

* Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket.

* Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

#### Why do we use them?

1. Hold unique values
2. Dictionary
3. Library
**Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.**

A hash is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location in the data structure that we can look at directly to retrieve the value.

* Hash maps take advantage of an arrayâ€™s O(1) read access.

#### Hashing
* A hash code turns a key into an integer.

* A hashtable traditionally is created from an array.

* Each index of the array can hold many types of values

#### Hash maps do this to store values:

1. accept a key
2. calculate the hash of the key
3. use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
4. store the key with the value by appending both to the end of a linked list

#### Hash maps do this to read value:

1. accept a key
2. calculate the hash of the key
3. use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
4. use the array index to access the short LinkedList representing a bucket
5. search through the bucket looking for a node with a key/value pair that matches the key you were given.
