## Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

## HTML

Headings :

# This is a Main Heading
## This is a Level 2 Heading
### This is a Level 3 Heading
#### This is a Level 4 Heading
##### This is a Level 5 Heading
###### This is a Level 6 Heading

## Paragraphs :

**Text is easier to understand when it is split up
 into units of text. For example, a book may have
 chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under
 each heading there will be one or more
 paragraphs.**

## Strong & Emphasis :

The use of the<strong>  element indicates that its content has strong importance. For example, the words contained in this element might be said with strong emphasis. By default, browsers will show the contents of a <strong>  element in bold.

If there is more than one element that have the same type, and you want to specilize one of them with some properaties, we use id. In the other hand, if there are a group that is wanted to have the same proparities, we use class.


## Basic JavaScript Instructions (page 53-page 84)
A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.

Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.

Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.

*Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.

JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false.

Expressions evaluate into a single value.
