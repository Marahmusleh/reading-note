 into units of text. For example, a book may have
 chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under
 each heading there will be one or more
 paragraphs.**

## Basic JavaScript Instructions (page 53-page 84)
A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.

Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.

Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.

*Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.

JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false.

Expressions evaluate into a single value.
