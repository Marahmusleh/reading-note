## HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

*Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.*
+ Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).
+ Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

# Ordered List 

<ol>
The ordered list is created with
the <ol> element.
<li>
Each item in the list is placed
between an opening <li> tag
and a closing </li> tag. (The li
stands for list item.)
  
# Unordered List 
  
  <ul>
The unordered list is created
with the <ul> element.
<li>
Each item in the list is placed
between an opening <li> tag
and a closing </li> tag. (The li
stands for list item.)
    
# Box Dimensions
# width, height
    
 div.box {
height: 300px;
width: 300px;
background-color: #bbbbaa;}
p {
height: 75%;
width: 75%;
background-color: #0088dd;}

Every box has three available properties that
can be adjusted to control its appearance:
    


## Decisions and Loops
    
-The for Loop
It lets JavaScript executes the statements repeatedly until it meets a certain condition. The syntax is:

for (initial expression; condition expression; loop expression)
{ Statements}
    
-The While Loop
The while statement allows us to control the number of times a procedure is performed. It is important to make that the repetition is not endless.
The algorithm is illustrated in example 8.3. The program will produce a pop-up dialog box 8 times prompting the user to enter the marks 8 times, 
then it will add up the marks and show the average mark.
