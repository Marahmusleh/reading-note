## Introductory HTML and JavaScript

# Structure HTML (page 12 -page 39)


-HTML pages are text documents.

-HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled Xbrackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.

-Tags are often referred to as elements.

-Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes Xthe start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.

-Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more Xabout the content of that element.

-Attributes require a name and a value.

-To learn HTML you need to know what tags are Xavailable for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

-HTML elements are used to describe the structure of Xthe page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

## What is CC ?
*Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .CSS file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .CSS file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting*.

## What is JavaScript?
*JavaScript is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.*
JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!
JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:

Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.
