## Git 

-it is a version control system which means everytime you change something in your project it will be recorded with a lot of information such as who commited the edit and when was it meaning you can work togather with your team or you group.

-it allows to continue work on a project even when not online or on a VPN by fetching history information from the server.

-Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.


The local Git repository has three components:

1-Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
2-Index: The area used for staging.
3-Head: Points to the most recent commit.

## Remote Repositories
```

    In order to collaborate on Git projects, you must interact with remote repositories, versions of a project residing online or on a network. You can work with multiple repositories, for which you can have read/write or read-only privileges. Teams can use remote repositories to push information to and pull data from.
