## Wireframe

## wireframe is a layout of a web page that demonstrates what interface elements will exist on key pages. It is a critical part of the interaction design process. Wireframes can also be used to create the global and secondary navigation to ensure the terminology and structure used for the site meets user expectations.

*Examples of wireframes*

Some people like to draw their wireframes by hand, others feel more comfortable using software like [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/), or [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create theirs.

## HTML

** _ HTML _ ** - Hypertext Markup Language - is the language used for creating web pages and other web-based documents. It consists mainly of matching pairs of angle-bracketed tags, enclosing sections of human-meaningful text.The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on

*The main parts of our element are as follows:*

-The opening tag.
-The closing tag.
-The content.
-The element.
  
  **content could be structured within a set of:**

  -Images.
  -Headings.
  -Paragraphs.
  -Lists.
  -Links.

  ## Semantics

  The semantics of a programming language describes what syntactically valid programs mean, what they do.

 >HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT are three basics which are essential to make a website. They are at the core of any website. Even a non-technical person having these three skills can add a spark to their career in whatever field they are. And suprisingly, it is not that tough to get equipped with it. 

 >HTML helps us to organise the elements of content into a Header, footer, paragraphs etc. An image on your right-hand side has CSS codes which make it look colourful and with images. Isn't it prettier? Javascript is a bit complex programming language that enables the developer to make the web application interactive.
